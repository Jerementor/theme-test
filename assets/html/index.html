        <p>Sick and tired of having countless game ideas that <strong>never get finished</strong>?</p>
        <p>I know I was... and I realized, there <em>had to be</em> another way.</p>
        <p>When you get an idea and are driven to pursue it, you might find a lot of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù pop into your head:</p>
        <ul class="jer_compact_ul">
          <li class="jer_compact_li">
            <div>What if I can‚Äôt program something?! ü§∑</div>
          </li>
          <li class="jer_compact_li">
            <div>What if someone else made this already!? ü§î</div>
          </li>
          <li class="jer_compact_li">
            <div>What if no one likes it? üò¢</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the worst ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù of them all...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div>What if I can‚Äôt complete it without adding in multiplayer!? ü§º</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We‚Äôve all been there and in this scenario, your game gets started and never completed or‚Ä¶ it takes YEARS to call it finished!</strong></p>
        <p>Learning to program can be a fun challenge, but when it comes to making games, it can be an immediate idea killer.</p>
        <p>The challenge then becomes‚Ä¶</p>
        <h2 class="jer_primary">‚ÄúHow can you make something with the coding knowledge you have now?‚Äù</h2>
        <p>It doesn‚Äôt matter what software you use.</p>
        <p>So long as it can produce a game, you should steer your direction to just completing something small.</p>
        <p>The reality is, you don‚Äôt need to know <em>that much about code</em> to make a game.</p>
        <div class="jer_hr"></div>
        <h2 class="jer_primary">Move away from technical programming tutorials until you need them</h2>
        <p>Tutorials on game development are <em>very focused</em> on delivering an end result. While, this may be useful for your programming skills, it won‚Äôt ever perfectly fit your own vision for your game.</p>
        <p>To start completing games, <strong>use tutorials only when you need them</strong>.</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs take a look at two of the most common scenarios when trying to make a game.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> You spend <em>weeks trying to make something</em> and half way through development, you no longer like your idea. You had visions for what it could be but the <em>scope just kept climbing higher and higher</em> and in the end, it was nothing but a big waste of time. üïê</li>
          <li><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> You dive in head first and are able to make your idea come to life! But then you wanted to <em>add another feature</em> and bam, you hit a wall. You look up the solution, and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll figure it out and keep developing until, uh oh, bam, another wall. This time you aren‚Äôt so lucky and you quit. üò≥</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a much better way to develop and complete your own game than these two scenarios.</p>
        <p>One that will help you assess if your idea is worth spending your time on, and one that won‚Äôt have you smacking into walls.</p>
        <div class="jer_hr"></div>
        <h2 class="jer_primary">Make a game in ONE hour.</h2>
        <p>Yep, that‚Äôs right, the answer to how you will start completing your game(s) is to give yourself sixty whole minutes.</p>
        <p>After a whole hour goes by one of the following will be true:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div>If your idea is <em>really engaging to you</em>, the more likely you will want to continue developing it past an hour.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>If you <em>didn‚Äôt find it that fun</em> you move on to your next idea, no sweat, only one hour lost.</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Being able to <em>identify which your game</em> is after ONE hour of development is the <em>missing ingredient</em> to completing more games because you will immediately figure out if you are making the right game for you.</p>
        <p>But...¬†there is more to it, than just spending an hour trying to develop something.</p>
        <p>You need to know <em>how</em> you can make something in such a short time frame.</p>
        <p>You need to follow <em>a proven principle</em> that will allow your tiny game to be clear in the idea it‚Äôs demonstrating.</p>
        <p>And, you need to have <em>the passion</em> to keep going if your idea flops (even if you do spend more than an hour on it) to make a new one.</p>
